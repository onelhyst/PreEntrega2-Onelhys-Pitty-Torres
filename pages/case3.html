            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">Background: A financial management tool was facing issues with user onboarding and engagement. New users found the initial setup confusing and were not fully utilizing the app’s features.</p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">Objective: To improve the onboarding experience and increase user engagement with the app’s features. </p>
            <p class="lead fw-medium">Process:</p>
            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
              <li class="list-group-item">Research: Conducted user interviews and analyzed drop-off rates during onboarding. Identified that users were confused by the setup process and did not understand the benefits of advanced features. </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Redesign: Developed an interactive onboarding experience with step-by-step guidance. Added tooltips and contextual help to explain features and their benefits. Simplified the setup process by integrating a user-friendly tutorial. </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Prototyping and Testing: Created prototypes of the new onboarding flow and conducted usability tests with new users. Gathered feedback to refine the onboarding process and address any remaining issues.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Implementation and Follow-Up: Implemented the redesigned onboarding experience and monitored user engagement metrics. Provided ongoing support and resources to help users get the most out of the app. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="lead fw-medium mt-4">Results:</p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush ">
              <li class="list-group-item">Reduced user drop-off during onboarding by 40%. </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Increased feature adoption by 25%, as users were more aware of and engaged with advanced features.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Improved user satisfaction and retention, with positive feedback highlighting the enhanced onboarding experience. </li>
